# My Portfolio Site

This is a personal site. I created it as a final project for an Internet Programming class and plan to maintain it for the foreseeable future.

On the art history page, click the button on a carousel slide to read a pdf of my relevant paper. These papers are from two years of art history classes - I've included both some early works and some more recent ones to celebrate my progress.

On the code and tech page, click an image to enlarge it, and click anywhere on the enlarged image to close it. The projects on the page are both personal and academic.

On the recipe page, click a recipe title in the sidebar to read my recipe. The recipes are the best ones I've developed over the past year or so.

The contact page is functional and uses the web3forms contact API to send submissions straight to my email inbox.
